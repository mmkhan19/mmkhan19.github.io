abstract: Repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure is the chief risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, the occurrence and severity of CTE varies widely among those with similar RHI exposure. Limited evidence suggests that the APOEÎµ4 allele may confer risk for CTE, but previous studies were small with limited scope.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A genotypic association study of APOE with CTE.
