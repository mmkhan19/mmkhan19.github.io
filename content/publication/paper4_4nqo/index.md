abstract: 4NQO carcinogen were given to mice in drinking water induced tumors in tongue and were treated with a b-catenin/CBP inhibitor. We saw reduction in tumor size with changes in cellular composition and programs as revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Targeting b-catenin/CBP complex with small molecule inhibitors in pre-clinical mouse models.
